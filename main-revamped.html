				<h2>Purpose</h2>
				<p>
				This little demo features advanced JavaScript aspects by implementing a 2d canvas capable of rendering basic shapes. 
				Despite the fact that there are CSS gems in the style.css file, the main focus is JavaScript.
				This little app has it all: namespace management, event handling, prototypal inheritance demonstrated through 
				a custom object hierarchy, augmentation of built-in objects.</p>
				<p>
				I prefer to employ the function-flavor of <span class="code">"use strict";</span> pragma to rid my code of 
				insidious bugs stemming from silent-errors type coercions and auto-assignments that the EcmaScript paradigm introduces. 
				I include two informational links to support this notion:
				<ol>
					<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2012/03/13/its-time-to-start-using-javascript-strict-mode/">N.Zacka's website</a></li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
				Following lies a list of features that are demonstrated with this little demo and some relevant references to back my work 
				and the techniques employed. Most of my inspiration and solutions comes from an excellent JavaScript manual called 
				<a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-JavaScript-for-Web-Developers-3rd-Edition.productCd-1118222199.html">Professional JavaScript 
				for Web Developers 3rd ed.</a>, by <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/">Nicholas Zackas</a>,
				as well as my primary online guide-reference-aid-help resource of <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> website.

				<dt>Custom reference types</dt>
				<dd>
				It is quite obvious that the notion of <em>Shape</em> is used heavily throughout this app. It goes without saying that Shape is implemented as a custom
				reference type, with its own constructor and public methods. In strict OO languages (e.g. <strong>Java</strong>) <em>Shape</em> would be an abstract class since each shape has its 
				own unique implementation of the <span class="code">draw()</span> function. In JavaScript we use other practices which manipulate the prototype object and which are
				leads us to...
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Inheritance management in JavaScript</dt>
				<dd>
				Subclassing in JavaScript can be quite challenging since several object-oriented concepts which are solid for strict OO languages, such 
				as Java and C#, are more fluid here. Continuing our previous example of the <em>Shape</em> custom type, we had to find a way to establish 
				a type of inheritance in order to share the common properties and functionalities among different shapes, but provide each one with its own
				private properties and unique implementation of functionalities. Thus, I employed the <strong>parasitic combination inheritance</strong> pattern
				as presented by N.Zackas in his book <em>Professional JavaScript for Web Developers</em> (p.214). This pattern enables subtypes to inherit 
				the prototype of a supertype, while preserving the reference to their own prototype. This way we establish a neat hierarchy and maintain a 
				consistent response from <span class="keyword">instanceof</span> calls (they return <span class="keyword">true</span> for "Object", "Shape" 
				and the current shape we are drawing).
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Global Object augmentation through prototype</dt>
				<dd>Occasionally we might need to augment the global functionality of a built-in type, such as Array or Object, in order to implement our
				ingenious ideas. While built-in types are immutable in traditional OO languages, in JavaScript it is quite trivial to attach properties and 
				methods to the prototype of a built-in type and use them normally thereafter. This is what I did in our example in the case of 
				<span class="code">Object.prototype.getType()</span> function. This one enables <em>all</em> objects in our code to query themselves about
				their own type. This is how I populate the <em>Shape Registry</em>'s Type column: <span class="code">shape.getType()</span>.</dd>
				
				<dt>Event handling</dt>					
				<dd>You will notice that I use a event delegation whenever possible. I implement
				one handler to manage multiple events from similar controls. Should we use discreet functions for each 
				control, the memory cost and performance impact would be greater as each function in JavaScript is an object. The
				less we have instantiated at any time, the better both in terms of performance and memory leaking issues.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Error handling</dt>
				<dd>
					Errors are an indispensable mechanism in JavaScript to deal with its lenient nature when dealing with object references
					of different types and various silent conversions. For example, using them regularly in the beginning of function bodies, we are guaranteed
					that the argument passed is of the correct type. If not execution is stopped and an error is thrown, usually with a more user-friendly explanation.
					Debugging becomes significantly easier to tackle.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Graphics implementation</dt>
				<dd>Canvas is an indispensable element in HTML5. It is powerful enough to handle all types of graphics, from simple 2d shapes, as in our
				example, to complex 3d ones and even animations. Although I only scratch the surface of its potential here, I demonstrate a solid display of its 2d capabilities
				along with some basic transformations (rotation).

					</ul>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Tables</dt>
				<dd>Tables are ideal to manage tabular data. Our collection of shapes with their own unique properties is a perfect candidate to display their potential.
				The <em>Shapes Registry</em> is styled in <strong>style.css</strong> and manipulated via our script's functions <span class="code">insertShapesRegistryRow()</span>,
				<span class="code">clearShapesRegistry()</span> and <span class="code">refreshShapesRegistry()</span>.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Helper functions</dt>
				<dd>
				Small utility functions that either clarify our intentions and improve readability or prevent code duplication, are
				essential in all programming languages, JavaScript included. Such examples in our system are the functions <span class="code">getRandomInt()</span> and
				<span class="code">getRandomColor()</span>.
